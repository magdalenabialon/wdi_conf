##1.  Description :page_with_curl:

WDIConference is a Melbourne-based tech conference for mid to senior level developers to network with each other and attend lectures from leading experts in the field.  Guests can peruse the site to view speakers, lecture topics, social events, and sponsors. Because the lectures are geared towards a more advanced audience, those interested in attending must pass a basic coding test to confirm their experience level prior to booking their seats.  After successfully passing the coding test and choosing seats we take payment via credit or debit card and you're in!
